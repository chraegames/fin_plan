      <H2>What “Coast FIRE” actually means</H2>
      <P>
        Most FIRE math asks how much you need to retire <em>today</em>. Coast FIRE
        flips the question: how much do you need invested <em>right now</em> so that,
        left untouched, it compounds into your retirement target by the time you
        actually stop working? Hit that number and you've reached Coast FIRE — you can
        stop saving for retirement entirely and simply earn enough to pay current
        bills while the portfolio does the rest.
      </P>

      <H2>The formula</H2>
      <P>
        Coast FIRE is just the present value of your future retirement target. If you
        expect to need a nest egg of <strong>N</strong> at retirement, your money has{' '}
        <strong>t</strong> years to grow, and you assume a real (after-inflation)
        return of <strong>r</strong>, then:
      </P>
      <UL>
        <LI>
          <strong>Coast number = N ÷ (1 + r)<sup>t</sup></strong>
        </LI>
        <LI>
          Example: target a $1,500,000 nest egg, 25 years out, at a 5% real return →
          you need about <strong>$443,000 invested today</strong>. After that, you
          never have to contribute another dollar to retirement accounts.
        </LI>
      </UL>
      <P>
        The two assumptions that move this number the most are the return rate and the
        time horizon. A single percentage point of return, compounded over decades,
        swings the answer dramatically — which is exactly why a year-by-year model
        beats a one-line formula.
      </P>

      <H2>Why model it instead of using one formula</H2>
      <P>
        A closed-form Coast FIRE number assumes a single fixed return and a single
        retirement target. Real plans aren't that tidy: returns vary, expenses change,
        you may keep contributing for a few more years, and taxes eat into withdrawals
        later. Modeling the full path — contributions, growth, inflation, and eventual
        drawdown — shows you not just the Coast number but what happens on either side
        of it.
      </P>
